speed 40
multiply delta_start -smooth steering-:
200 crazy
100 still swings bad, crazy at straight roads
0.001 crazy more than 200
0.1 swings bad on straight, crash on curves 
50 bad curves, but stop swinging gradualy
25 too bad curves, but stop swinging gradualy
10 crazy !
Note : I have to tune a_start as well
delta 10 , a 10 : take curves good, swings less after curves
delta 100, a 100: both are bad
delta 10 , a 100: take curves slowly make it crash
delta 100, a 10 : still take curves slow, but survive curves
delta 500, a 10 : no swings, still take curves slow and crash
delta 150, a 15 : no swings, still take curves slow
keep delta 100, a10

increase speed to 100
delta 100, a 10 : is not working anymore
change speed to 50
delta 100, a 10 : is not working anymore
  but changing N from 10 to 20 can make diffrance, 
  not good but remarks that changes to speed requires change in N

==========================

managed to work Speed = 55
while with x,y,psi,v,cte,epsi,delta,a=1
N = 7 & dt = 0.1
==========================
increasing speed to 65
tuening N & dt is not working
have to tune other params

tune cte_start :
* 50 = car starts to brake cuves, sometimes crashs
* 100 = better curves but mor wiggle after curves
* 200	= even brakes better, but serius wiggle problem cause carsh
tune delta_start :
* 100 = still wiggle after first curve
tune a_start :
* 10 = pass 1st curve good, wiggle after 2nd curve
tune delta_start :
*200 = better stearing at curves, more wiggle after
tune a_start :
* 50 = less wiggly, but not satisfying
* 100 = no improvment
* 50  back to 50
__________ 
speed=65 , N=7 , dt=0.1 , cte_start=200 , 
delta_start=300 , a_start=50
good but wiggles after some curves
_________
trying to tune cte again
tune cte_start :
* 400 = better brake at curves, but wiggle
tune delta_start :
*500 = more steady after curves
tune a_start :
* 100=less wiggles , but maybe we need more cte effect
tune cte_start :
* 800 = no no ,backup
___________
last trial for 75
cte_*400, epsi_*200, delta3_*500, a3_*60 = crash in 3rd turn
cte_ * 4000 = good breaks , swing too hard on high speed
epsi_*2000 = longer brakes, swings more on low speeds
epsi*200 -> just reset
delta3*200 = steer gently, cause crash on sharp curves
_________________
back to speed=55
N=8, dt=0.1, cte_*2000, epsi_*1000, delta_*200, a_*50
crash after 3rd turn
________________
speed=60
N=8, dt=0.1,
delta*200
a*10 bad
a*15 bad
a*20 better
a*25 better
epsi = 4000 , better at curves but wiggle after first round
epsi = 2000 same
cte = 6000 , stopped wiggling
cte = 4000 , still fine
Notice break hard at curves, wiggle hard at initial state
can't fix that tuning only 1st & 3rd loops
tuninig 2nd loop :
2nd delta*5 bad
2nd a*5 mmm 
2nd delta*5 a*1 bad
2nd delta*5 a*2 bad
2nd delta*5 a*3 mmm
2nd delta*3 a*3 Yes !
=================================
push mile stone
speed=60, N=8, dt=0.1,
1st cte*4000, epsi*2000
2nd delta*3 a*3
3rd delta*200 a*25
==================================
